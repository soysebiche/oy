# Interactive Analysis of Opportunity Youth in U.S. Metro Areas

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an interactive data visualization to analyze the number and percentage of **Opportunity Youth (OY)** in major U.S. metropolitan areas. The visualization will focus on data from 2022 and 2023, allowing for temporal comparison.

This project is inspired by the functionality and design of the [Measure of America](https://www.measureofamerica.org/DYInteractive/) visualizer, specifically replicating its "BY METRO AREA" section.

The goal is to use data from IPUMS (already downloaded) and process it with R to generate the necessary inputs for a web visualization.

## Key Features

1.  **Interactive Map:** A choropleth or bubble map of U.S. metropolitan areas showing the rate of disconnected youth.
2.  **Disaggregated Table:** A table displaying OY data disaggregated by gender and race/ethnicity for each metropolitan area, with comparative data for 2022 and 2023.
3.  **Interactivity:** Hovering or clicking on a metropolitan area will display detailed information (area name, OY %, total OY, and subgroup breakdown).
4.  **Annual Comparison:** Functionality to switch the map visualization between 2022 and 2023 data.
5.  **Table Filters:** Filters for gender and race/ethnicity to refine the data displayed in the detailed table.
6.  **National Totals:** Display of national aggregate data when no specific metropolitan area is selected.

## Data Source

-   **Primary Data:** [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/), American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates.
-   **Years:** 2022 and 2023.
-   **Population of Interest:** Young people aged 16 to 24 who are neither enrolled in school nor working.

## Proposed Technology Stack

-   **Data Processing:**
    -   **R:** Using libraries like `dplyr` for manipulation, `sf` for spatial data, `jsonlite` for JSON export, and `tigris` for geographic data acquisition.
    -   The objective is to generate clean data files in `.geojson` and `.json` formats that can be easily consumed by the web application.
-   **Frontend (Visualization):**
    -   **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)**
    -   **Leaflet.js:** For interactive mapping.
    -   **D3.js:** For data handling and dynamic table generation.
